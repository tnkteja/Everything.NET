# Everything.NET

## First Impressions

First of all there is Common Language Runtime for all the lanuages it supports, well obviou*silly* common windows platform compilable language runtime. . They call it framework, well who am i to argue with that - I would just leave it at that. Their strengh is their Visual Studio , the ability to tie up the features across various development lifes.

Lets just say its easy to comprehend what windows people does in an adhoc way, rather than to piece together and get an idea of what they are up to.  They have this thing called their of version of everthing in this world for example cloud called azure, with windows operating  system ( **haha haha haha** *I know* ). Since they are clear on what their world will look like pretty much introverted or **windtroverted**, they do lot of cool tweaks and features to their platforms may it be development or tools or sdks e.t.c  `Why do I feel silly writinfg about these people ?` From time to time thery piece together from whats happening in the world into their own puppy, making it cuter and cuter everyday ( *aah I need  to break a wall with that kind of sweetness* ) So to understand their thing, don't be smart, just be at something else and they will creep on to what you are looking at at some point.



> Learning human history is boring. AHA imagine learning history about asp.net, it is as dry as it gets. hufewww.

so I decided, dont pursue it, but keep in touch with it like you keep a constant tocuh of your self.

So finally in all fairness, I will try to tie together, what they are doing with impresssion from the outside world.
